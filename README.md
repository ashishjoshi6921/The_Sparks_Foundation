# The_Sparks_Foundation_March_2021
This is a repository of the codes that I have developed for my assignments as a Data Science and Business Analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation. 
This code is for Task 1, for March 2021.
Given the data of students that included their percentage and the number of hours studied.
using simple linear regression, the code is developed to predict the percentage if the number of hours studied data is known.
The variables are described in the code.
